/**
 * Verifies a card whose `deliverable_type` is "artifact" actually produced
 * the artifact it claims -- not just code that could produce one. A card's
 * `attachments[]` frontmatter (populated only by a real
 * `POST /api/tasks/:id/attachments` call, never by an implementer editing
 * `tasks/**` directly -- implementers have no Write/Edit access there) is
 * the one place a real, board-recorded deliverable shows up; an "artifact"
 * card with an empty attachments list is exactly the T-0136 failure mode:
 * an uploader CLI with fully mocked, green tests that never actually
 * uploaded anything. When `attachmentsDir` is supplied, each recorded
 * attachment is additionally cross-checked against the file it claims
 * exists on disk (`tasks/attachments/<id>/<filename>`, per the attachments
 * feature) -- a frontmatter entry with no backing file is the same failure
 * mode by a different route. A `deliverable_type` other than "artifact"
 * (the default, "code") is not applicable -- this check has nothing to say
 * about code-deliverable cards -- unless `requireArtifact` is passed.
 *
 * `requireArtifact` overrides that default-"code" exemption: pass `true`
 * when the caller has independent evidence (not the card's own
 * self-reported `deliverable_type`) that this card must have a produced
 * deliverable attached. `verifyRouter.js`'s `resolveDeliverableRoute` sets
 * this when the diff itself adds/updates a file under a known
 * artifact-producing path (`assets/final/**`, `assets/src/concept/**`,
 * `assets/src/keyart/**`) -- the mechanical backstop for the pattern where
 * several art/audio cards (character sheets, concept art, an ambience bed)
 * were committed straight to the repo tagged `deliverable_type: "code"`
 * and never attached, so the plain `deliverable_type`-gated check above
 * never even ran for them.
